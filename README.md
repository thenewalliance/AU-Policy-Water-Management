# Water Management

- Return water to the river systems for the benefit of country towns and the environment
- Phase in water sparing crops
- Phase out water intensive crops unless their continued use can be justified by a combination of profitability and the availability of more water through technological advances such as the pumping of desalinated water.
- Long term increase in Australia’s water availability enabling crop intensification, supporting population shifts from urban to rural areas and the increased availability of rural jobs through our Job Guarantee Scheme.

We acknowledge that Australia is a country in which water has always been a scarce resource, and that its logical use and distribution is essential not only for rural communities and for the environment but for the economic health of the nation. We also understand that certain rural industries which, with the benefit of hindsight, should perhaps never have been undertaken, will wish to continue cropping.

The balance is to ensure that water intensive crops which are inappropriate for arid and semi-arid farming are progressively phased out, and more appropriate water sparing crops are phased in. During that process we will ensure that water allocations are strictly observed. Individuals and corporations who wish to continue farming inappropriate crops, will of course be allowed to do so if that is their business choice, but they will not be able to access water in excess of their fair allocation to do so.

As a result, we will return proper flow to the Murray Darling system, so that water security is ensured for country towns and the environment. Whilst this will be, and Constitutionally must be, our first priority, compensation will be paid to any industry which suffers short term losses as a result of the changeover, and to any individuals who become temporarily unemployed.

We will employ the best advice from around the world on water conservation, and management, to increase security to country towns, farmers and the environment.

We will also move towards improved efficiency in reservoir management and ground water use, and improvements in water technology will be the first priority for our Department of Innovation and Entrepreneurship. This, together with water savings from more appropriate cropping, will enable us, in the long term to increase Australia’s overall water availability.

We oppose and will abolish the ability of people and entities, who are not landholders, to trade in water on, or flowing through that land.
